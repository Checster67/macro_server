# First Thoughts

	My brother. 

	~recall the parts of your old self that you killed and butchered~
	~never let them creep back in, for they will surely try~

	~take care of your body~
	~put it as a top priority~

	~strengthen your mental, don't be afraid to go where it hurts, never, it is your home~
	~comfort kills~

	~achieve your goals, go upwards, always~

	My brother, see what you are, who you are. 


# The Chapel of Dead Selves

	The PEOPLE PLEASER, has been bludgeoned to death with a hammer,
		by someone who only gives a fuck about himself. 

	The COMPLAINY COMPLAINER, has been burned alive with a flamethrower,
		by someone who sees complaining as pure weakness and filth.

	The OVERSHARING little bitch, has been sliced open with a dagger,
		by someone who never shares what is valuable to him.

	The DECISION DOUBTER, has been thrown like swine in a pit of snakes and scorpions,
		by someone who knows that doubting decisions is the opposite of self love.

	The EXPECTATION OVERTHINKER, has been fucked by a horse, and fed to the pigs.
		staring down was someone who knows overthinking is a waste of energy. 

	The REFLECTION SEEKER, his face was pierced by thousand mirror shards,
		by someone who seeks his reflection only in his mind's eye,
		whilst his real eyes are only focused towards what is ahead of him.

	The BITCH ACTOR, dragged by his hair, has been force fed his womanish costumes and makeup,
		by someone who cannot stand the sight of a person, who moans lowder than he needs to.


# The Heron Bird, and the Death of a Lover Boy

	i fell from the sky once and
	landed in a river
	my back nearly broken from the impact
	in front of me stood a bird
	akin to a stork, but not one

	he looked at me curiously
	i imagined he was weeping
	his long beak as long as a sword
	and his eyes were piercing, as if it knew me
	a tear rolled down from one of his blue eyes
	more blue than the Ocean
	this blue haunts me to this day

	i tried to reach for the tear
	for it held the Aegean see in it, i knew in my heart
	before i could do so, it screamed
	an eldritch, beautifully haunting noise
	containing all the sorrow i have known in this life
	and past
	yet i am me and no one else

	it suddenly flew down, and i felt such wonderful pain
	realising it had cut me, in my abdomen
	and flew away

	all was silent, and i was left there
	in the river, oh so cold
	i wept, and cried... for days
	and there, i died, cold. i went into the rocks,
	the trees, the wind, the icy peaks, the darkness,
	the clouds. i could see all... i was happy. 

	but oh what a sight, when i looked upon that river
	a man was coming out of it, dark eyes...
	this man will haunt this place for ever
	for he was born in it.
	he had a scar on his abdomen.
	his eyes held love for nothing but himself,
	yet for everything.
	so dark were his eyes, as if he's been through
	a million wars.

	he despises me. yet i love him with all my heart. 
	he despises who i am. who i was. yet looks at me
	with serenity, not knowing it is me. 

	and so he walked away.
	and so the world ended. 
	and so it is silent now,
	eternal. 

	and for eternity i weep.
	for this man has abandoned me. 
	and this land holds no souls i can see
	where to pour all this love unto.
